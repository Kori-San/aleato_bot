A Simple Telegram Bot that allows you to randomize. A lot.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
Since the **Telegram API** restrict a lot of **Bot actions**, this **Bot** uses both a '*Bot connection*' **AND** an '*User connection*'. 

For the *Bot* to work perfectly you will need to have both your *Bot* **AND** *the User used for the server* in the channel where the *Bot* will be used.
> The User doesn't need to have high privileges in most cases but **the Bot needs to be an Administrator**. 

The first time you'll launch the server, *Telethon* will ask you for your **Phone Number**, **2FA Code** and **Password**. Those informations will be crypted by Telethon into a `.session` file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Make rules
- ***run***:            Runs the Bot's server
- ***help***:           Show this help.
- ***help-md***:        Show this help but in a markdown styled way. This can be used when updating the Makefile to generate documentation and simplify README.md's 'Make rules' section update.
- ***autophony***:      Generate a .PHONY rule for your Makefile using all rules in the Makefile(s).
- ***venv***:           Generate a Python Virtual Environnement and install all needed packages.
- ***freeze***:         Freeze all the packages into the files used to create the virtual environnement.
- ***info***:           Display information about the Virtual Environnement.
- ***clean***:          Clean all the generated files and folders.

## üîí Secrets
- `API_ID` and `API_HASH` can be acquired when registering to [The Telegram Apps Website](https://my.telegram.org/auth).
- `API_TOKEN` can be acquired by creating a bot thanks to [@BotFather on Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot).
- `USER_SESSION` and `BOT_SESSION` are the name of the `.session` files generated by *Telethon*.
